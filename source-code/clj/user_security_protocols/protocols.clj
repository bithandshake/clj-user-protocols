(defn check-user-identifier

(defn verify-security-code-unauthenticated
  ; @description
  ; - Security protocol function for verifying a security code (for unauthenticated users) sent via email / SMS.
  ; - Performs various security checks before returns a HTTP response that indicates if any check has been failed or the action was successful.
  ;
  ; @note
  ; - For performing additional side effects use the 'additional-action-f' function (applied if no security check has been failed).
  ; - For implementing additional security levels use the 'additional-security-f' function (applied as last security check).
  ; - In case the 'provide-user-session-f' function is passed, no security check has been failed, and the received security code is correct,
  ;   it applies the 'provide-user-session-f' function on the HTTP response.

(defn verify-user-password
  ; @description
  ; - Security protocol function for user password verification (for unauthenticated users) and in case of correct user password has been
  ;   received optionally sending an MFA security code / providing a user session.
  ; - Performs various security checks before returns a HTTP response that indicates if any check has been failed or the action was successful.
  ;
  ; @note
  ; - For performing additional side effects use the 'additional-action-f' function (applied if no security check has been failed).
  ; - For implementing additional security levels use the 'additional-security-f' function (applied as last security check).
  ; - In case the 'send-security-code-f' function is passed, no security check has been failed, and the received user password is correct,
  ;   it applies the 'send-security-code-f' (it's a common scenario when the user credentials verification is followed by login code verification).
  ; - In case the 'provide-user-session-f' function is passed, the 'send-security-code-f' function is NOT passed, no security check has
  ;   been failed, and the received user password is correct, it applies the 'provide-user-session-f' function on the HTTP response.
